<h1>FAQs<br>
<h2>Is Reader's Paradise only book related?</h2>
  <p>Yes, Reader's Paradise is completely book related but you can also find people with different interests here.</p>

    <p>No, Absolutely No. We understand that every reader or any type of person have their own perspectives and choices about things and we respect them. This is a rule we 
      follow in our server.

  <h2>Does a person need to be a reader<br>to join you?</h2>
    <p>It is not necessary that you can only join if you are a reader. As i mentioned before, We are a welcoming community, We welcome
      everyone with pleasure and happiness. Your choices, What you read/watch/write, Your gender, Nothing like that matters, We are here
